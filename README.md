# Mystec
[Modpack on Curseforge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/mystec "Mystec modpack on Curseforge") (under construction)

Whatever your goal is: write Ages (dimensions), farming/cooking/husbandry, create complex machines/contraptions, splashing the scene with beautiful builds or just wandering around and set up camp now and then, you'll find it in this (large!) pack.

- Free-roam exploring (no quests, but hint guide is in the making)
- Beautiful landscape (Biome Bundle)
- Great variety of flora and fauna
- Pseudo peaceful-mode available (with mob drops)

It's a pack for **personal** use, filled with client side QoL mods. A minimum of 6GB RAM is recommended, see the [wiki](https://github.com/blutec-dev/Mystec/wiki "wiki") for more information, suggestions, configuration and choices.

Inspirations for this modpack are the Myst series ([Cyan games](https://cyan.com/games/ "Cyan games")) and Life in the Woods ([Phedran](http://www.phedran.com/ "Phedran")).
